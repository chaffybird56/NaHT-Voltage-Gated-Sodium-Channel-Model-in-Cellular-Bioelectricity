This repository contains MATLAB code for simulating a high-threshold voltage-gated sodium channel (NaHT) model in cellular bioelectricity. The project explores NaHT channel dynamics, including activation, spiking patterns, and refractory properties, with additional scripts for threshold and refractory demos.
